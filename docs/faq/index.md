## Backend Setup

### How do I load initial data for development?

You can load development and test fixtures in two ways:

1. Using make:

```bash
make load-fixtures
```

2. Using Docker directly:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash -c "python manage.py load_fixtures"
```

### How do I load location-specific government organization data?

To load data for a specific state (e.g., Kerala), use:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash -c "python manage.py load_govt_organization --state kerala --load-districts --load-local-bodies --load-wards"
```

### How do I create a superuser account?

To create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash -c "python manage.py createsuperuser"
```

Follow the prompts to enter username, email, and password.

### How do I fix permission and role issues?

If you encounter access or permission issues, run:

```bash
python manage.py sync_permissions_roles
```

This ensures that user roles are correctly mapped to permissions.

### What should I do if the backend container is unhealthy?

1. Check the logs for error messages:

```bash
docker logs <container_name>
# Example:
docker logs care-backend-1
```

2. Open the Django shell for debugging:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> python manage.py shell
# Example:
docker exec -it care-backend-1 python manage.py shell
```

3. Rebuild and restart the services:

```bash
make teardown
make up
```

## Frontend Setup

### What Node.js version is required?

The frontend projects require **Node.js 22**. Use `nvm` to install and switch versions:

```bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

To verify the active Node version:

```bash
node -v
```

**Note**: Always sync with the latest **develop** branch before starting frontend work.

### How do I resolve dependency installation issues?

If you see peer dependency warnings or install failures:

1. Try installing with legacy peer deps:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. If issues persist:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### How do I fix API connection issues?

1. Ensure the backend server is running
2. Check your `.env` file in the frontend project:

```env
REACT_CARE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

### How do I fix build errors?

If you encounter TypeScript errors or linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint-fix
```

### What should I do if Cypress tests are failing?

Cypress test failures are often specific to individual PRs and may not indicate a broader issue with your local setup. If you encounter failing Cypress tests:

1. **Check if tests pass locally**:

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:run
   ```

2. **Run tests in interactive mode for debugging**:

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

3. **If tests fail consistently**, discuss the issue in the [Slack community](https://slack.ohc.network) - the community can help identify if it's a known issue or specific to your PR.

**Note**: Many Cypress failures are flaky tests that pass on retry. If tests fail in CI but pass locally, it's often a timing or environment issue rather than a code problem.

## Plugin Setup

### How do I set up a plugin?

Most plugins follow this pattern in `plug_config.py`:

```python
plugin_name = Plug(
    name="plugin_name",
    package_name="git+https://github.com/ohcnetwork/plugin_repo.git",
    version="@master",  # or specific version
    configs={},  # plugin-specific settings
)
plugs = [plugin_name]
```

### How do I develop plugins locally?

### Backend

1. Update `plug_config.py`:

```python
plugin_name = Plug(
    name="plugin_name",
    package_name="/app/plugin_folder",
    version="",
    configs={},
)
```

2. In `plugs/manager.py`, install in editable mode:

```python
subprocess.check_call(
    [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-e", *packages]
)
```

3. Rebuild and restart the containers:

```bash
make re-build
make up
```

### Frontend

1. Setup & run the plug according to the commands in plug's package.json

For example: care_abdm_fe

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run start
```

2. Update .env in care_fe:

```env
REACT_ENABLED_APPS="ohcnetwork/plugin_name_fe@localhost:5173"
```

3. Generate pluginMap and install plugin configurations in care_fe:

```bash
npm run setup
```

4. Run care_fe

```bash
npm run dev
```

### What should I do if a plugin isn't loading?

For backend plugins:

- Ensure the plugin name matches the Django app name
- Verify the path or repository URL is correct
- Check that all required environment variables are configured

For frontend plugins:

- Verify you're using the correct Node.js version
- In `care_fe/.env`, ensure the plugin is added to `REACT_ENABLED_APPS`:

```env
REACT_ENABLED_APPS="ohcnetwork/plugin_name_fe@localhost:5173"
```

- Make sure the plugin dev server is running on the expected port
